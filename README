This is a temporary fork of tmlong's Gmail Manager addon, to fix
broken things that make the add-on unable to use.  I do not plan on
maintaining this long-term; but will help as I can.  If you find any
problems, please use the fork button on the github page.

Hopefully he'll come back and update the addon again; in the mean time, since I
have already fixed it for myself, I might as well put the changes up under the
original tri-license (MPL 1.1/GPL 2.0/LGPL 2.1).
